# 🔄 Simulation of Real-Life Events Using Markov Chains and Stochastic Matrices

This repository contains a collection of simulations and visualizations of real-life systems using Markov chains and stochastic matrices. It was developed as part of an undergraduate research project for MATH 444 (Western Illinois University).

## 📚 Overview

Markov chains offer a powerful framework for modeling systems that transition from one state to another probabilistically. This project includes multiple case studies that apply these principles to realistic scenarios, including health dynamics, weather patterns, and movement through networked systems.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `7 State Problem/`  
  Simulation of transitions across a custom 7-node network; includes transition matrix setup and long-term behavior analysis.

- `Cycle Problem/`  
  A cyclical Markov chain that illustrates predictable transitions in a closed loop (ideal for theoretical understanding).

- `Illness Problem/`  
  Health-related Markov chain with absorbing states to represent recovery or worsening conditions over time.

- `Weather Problem/`  
  Forecasting model for sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather transitions; includes short- and long-term prediction visualization.

- `MATH444 Proposal.docx`  
  Formal proposal describing the motivation, methodology, and goals of the project.

- `MATH 444 - Undergraduate Research Project Presentation.pptx`  
  Final presentation slide deck used to present findings, code, and visual interpretations.
